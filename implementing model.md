# Audio Deepfake Detection - CLAD Model Implementation

## Implementation Process

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Dataset Issues**

   - The **ASVspoof dataset** contains **audio files with different sample rates**, which can cause inconsistencies when feeding data into the model.
   - Labels are not explicitly stored in a structured way, requiring us to infer them from filenames.

2. **Model Selection & Optimization**

   - Choosing the **right input representation**: Should we use raw waveforms, spectrograms, or MFCCs?
   - **Computational constraints**: Some models (e.g., transformers) are **too heavy for real-time inference**.

3. **Training Stability**

   - **Gradient explosion** occurred due to improper input normalization.
   - **Batch size tuning**: Using a **batch size of 16** helped stabilize training without causing memory issues.

### Solutions Applied

1. **Standardized Audio Processing**

   - Used `librosa.load()` to ensure all audio files are resampled to **16kHz** before training.
   - Normalized waveforms to prevent large value discrepancies.

2. **Feature Representation & Model Optimization**

   - Chose **raw waveform input** to reduce preprocessing time and **allow the model to learn features directly**.
   - Used **lightweight CNN architecture** with an **attention mechanism** to focus on key audio features.

3. **Efficient Training Strategy**

   - **Batch size of 16** to balance performance and memory usage.
   - **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of `0.001` to ensure stable training.
   - **CrossEntropyLoss** for classification since we are dealing with binary labels (real vs. fake).

## Analysis of the CLAD Model

### Why This Model?

- **Lightweight architecture** → Suitable for **real-time detection**.
- **Attention mechanism** → Helps model focus on key patterns distinguishing real vs. fake voices.
- **No heavy preprocessing** → Unlike spectrogram-based models, this operates on raw waveforms.

### How the Model Works (Technical Explanation)

- **1D Convolution Layer** extracts short-term frequency features.
- **Attention Mechanism** dynamically enhances important features.
- **Fully Connected Layer** classifies the sample as **real or fake**.

### Performance Results

- **Training Loss**: After 5 epochs, loss stabilized around **0.3**, indicating **good convergence**.
- **Accuracy**: Preliminary tests on the validation set suggest **\~85% accuracy**, but further tuning is needed.

### Strengths & Weaknesses

#### ✅ Strengths

- **Fast inference** (suitable for real-time applications).
- **Simple architecture**, easy to deploy on edge devices.
- **Attention layer improves feature selection**, reducing false positives.

#### ❌ Weaknesses

- Limited performance on **adversarial deepfakes** (e.g., audio generated using advanced neural codecs).
- Could struggle with **low-quality real recordings**, mistaking them as fake.

### Future Improvements

- **Introduce spectrogram-based features** (e.g., Mel spectrograms) to help the model detect frequency distortions.
- **Adversarial training** with manipulated deepfake audio to improve robustness.
- **Fine-tuning on larger datasets** to generalize better across different languages and accents.

## Reflection

### 1. What Were the Most Significant Challenges?

- **Efficient dataset loading**: Had to ensure consistent **sampling rates** and **labels**.
- **Choosing the right model**: A balance between **lightweight inference** and **detection accuracy**.
- **Stable training**: Finding the optimal **batch size, optimizer, and loss function**.

### 2. Real-World Performance vs. Research Datasets

- Research datasets are **well-structured**, but real-world data is **messy**.
- **Real-world challenges**:
  - **Background noise**: Actual conversations have **ambient sounds**, unlike clean dataset recordings.
  - **Audio compression**: Fake audios in the wild may be **recompressed**, making detection harder.

### 3. Additional Data or Resources Needed?

- **More diverse deepfake samples**: Different synthesis techniques (e.g., Tacotron, WaveNet, FastSpeech).
- **Noisy real-world datasets** to improve generalization.

### 4. Deploying This Model in Production

#### **Preprocessing Pipeline**

- Standardize all audio to **16kHz** before inference.
- Apply **simple noise reduction** if necessary.

#### **Model Optimization**

- Convert to **ONNX** for optimized real-time inference.
- Deploy in a **Docker container** with a lightweight API.

#### **Real-Time Detection Framework**

- Implement as a **background service** for streaming audio analysis.
- Introduce a **confidence threshold** to minimize false alarms.
